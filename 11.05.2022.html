Flip-Flop:-
1) A flip-flop is a bi-stable device. It has 2 stable states. Its O/P remains 
either high or low. 
2) The high stable state is called SET. The other stable state is called 
RESET. 
3) It can store binary bit, rather 0 or 1. Thus, it has storing capability, 
i.e., memory.
4) The most commonly used application of flip flops is in the 
implementation of a feedback circuit 
The main difference between latches and flip-flops is that 
 For latches when they are enabled, their output changes immediately 
when their inputs change.
 Latch is level sensitive and there is no use of clock. 
 Flip-flops have their output change only either at the rising or filling 
edge of the enable signal.  Flip-flop is edge sensitive and we need clock to design a flip-flop 
There are basically five main types of latches and flip-flops: 
1. SR Flip-flop. 
2. D Flip flop. 
3. JK Flip-flop 
4. T Flip flop. 
5. Master-Slave Flip-flop.
The major differences in these flip-flop types are the number of inputs they 
have and how they change state.
1)SR Latch:-  RS latch have two inputs, S and R. S is called set and R is called reset. 
 The S input is used to produce HIGH on Q (i.e. store binary 1 in flip-flop). 
 The R input is used to produce LOW on Q (i.e. store binary 0 in flip-flop). 
 Q’ is Q complementary output, so it always holds the opposite value of Q. 
 The output of the S-R latch depends on current as well as previous inputs 
or state, and its state (value stored) can change as soon as its inputs 
change. 
Working:-
S=1, R=0—Q=0, Q’=1
This state is also called the SET state.
S=0, R=1—Q=1, Q’=0
This state is known as the RESET state.
In both the states the outputs are just compliments of each other and 
that the value of Q follows the compliment value of S.
S=0, R=0—Q=1, & Q’ =1 [Invalid]
If both the values of S and R are switched to 0 it is an invalid state 
because the values of both Q and Q’ are 1. They are supposed to be 
compliments of each other. Normally, this state must be avoided.
S=1, R=1—Q & Q’= Remember
If both the values of S and R are switched to 1, then the circuit 
remembers the value of S and R in their previous state.
SR Flip-Flop:-  It is basically S-R latch using NAND gates with an additional enable 
input. It is also called as level triggered SR-FF. 
 For this, circuit in output will take place if and only if the enable input 
(E) is made active.
 It is also called a Gated S-R flip flop.

Truth Table
Working:-
I. A clock pulse [CP] is given to the inputs of the AND Gate. 
II. When the value of the clock pulse is ‘0’, the outputs of both the AND Gates 
remain ‘0’. 
III. When CP is ‘1’, this makes the values at S and R to pass through the 
NOR Gate flip flop. 
IV. But when the values of both S and R values turn ‘1’, the HIGH value of CP 
causes both of them to turn to ‘0’.
S = R = 0: No change
If S =R = 0 then output of NAND gates 3 and 4 are forced to become 1.
Hence R' and S' both will be equal to 1. Since S' and R' are the input of 
the basic S-R latch using NAND gates, there will be no change in the state 
of outputs.
S = 0, R = 1, E = 1
Since S = 0, output of NAND-3 i.e. R' = 1 and E = 1 the output of NAND-
4 i.e. S' = 0.
Hence Qn+1 = 0 and Qn+1 bar = 1. This is reset condition.
S = 1, R = 0, E = 1
Output of NAND-3 i.e. R' = 0 and output of NAND-4 i.e. S' = 1.
Hence output of S-R NAND latch is Qn+1 = 1 and Qn+1 bar = 0. This is 
the reset condition.
S = 1, R = 1, E = 1
As S = 1, R = 1 and E = 1, the output of NAND gates 3 and 4 both are 0 
i.e. S' = R' = 0.
Hence the Race condition will occur in the basic NAND latch.
Excitation Table of the SR Latch
 During the design process we usually know the transition from present state 
to next state and wish to find the latch input conditions that will cause the 
required transition.
 For this reason, we need a table that lists the required inputs for a given 
change of state
Characteristic Table
Delay/Data Flip Flop / D Flip Flop
1. Delay Flip Flop or D Flip Flop is the simple gated S-R latch with a NAND
inverter connected between S and R inputs.
2. It has only one input. The input data is appearing at the output after some
time. Due to this data delay between i/p and o/p, it is called delay flip flop.
3. S and R will be the complements of each other due to NAND inverter.
Hence S = R = 0 or S = R = 1, these input condition will never appear.
This problem is avoid by SR = 00 and SR = 1 conditions.
(Block Diagram) (Circuit Diagram)
Truth Table
Working:-
1.E = 0
Latch is disabled. Hence no change in output.
2.E = 1 and D = 0
If E = 1 and D = 0 then S = 0 and R = 1. Hence irrespective of the
present state, the next state is Qn+1 = 0 and Qn+1 bar = 1. This is the
reset condition.
3.E = 1 and D = 1
If E = 1 and D = 1, then S = 1 and R = 0. This will set the latch and
Qn+1 = 1 and Qn+1 bar = 0 irrespective of the present state.
JK Flip-Flop:-
Characteristic Table
Excitation Table and K Map
 A J-K flip flop can also be defined as a modification of the S-R flip flop.
 The behaviour of inputs J and K is same as the S and R inputs of the S￾R flip flop. The letter J stands for SET and the letter K stands for CLEAR.
 If the J and K input are both at 1 and the clock pulse is applied, then the 
output will change state, regardless of its previous condition.
 If both J and K inputs are at 0 and the clock pulse there will be no change 
in the output. 
 There is no indeterminate condition, in the operation of JK.
Working:-  The circuit includes two 3-input AND gates. The output Q of the flip flop is 
returned back as a feedback to the input of the AND along with other 
inputs like K and clock pulse [CP]. 
 So, if the value of CP is ‘1’, the flip flop gets a CLEAR signal and with 
the condition that the value of Q was earlier 1. 
 Similarly output Q’ of the flip flop is given as a feedback to the input of the 
AND along with other inputs like J and clock pulse [CP]. 
 So the output becomes SET when the value of CP is 1 only if the value of 
Q’ was earlier 1
 The output may be repeated in transitions once they have been 
complimented for J=K=1 because of the feedback connection in the JK flip￾flop
Truth Table: Excitation Table
T – Flip Flop:-
Characteristic Table And K Map:
 The T flip-flop is a single input version of the JK flip-flop where T is 
connected to both J and K inputs directly.
 When T = 0, the flip flop enters into Hold mode, which means that the 
output, Q is kept the same as it was before the clock edge.  When T = 1, the flip flop enters into Toggle mode, which means the output 
Q is negated after the clock edge, compared to the value before the clock 
edge.

Characteristic equation of T-Flip Flop:
Qn + 1 = T ⊕ Qn
Race Around Condition:
The race around condition will occur in JK flip flop when 
J = K = 1 and tpd (FF) < tpw.
To avoid race around condition.
tpw < tpd (FF) < TCLK
Master Slave JK Flip Flop:-
Master slave JK FF is a cascade of two S-R FF with feedback from the output of 
second to input of first. Master is a positive level triggered. But due to the 
presence of the inverter in the clock line, the slave will respond to the negative 
level. Hence when the clock = 1 (positive level) the master is active and the 
slave is inactive. Whereas when clock = 0 (low level) the slave is active and 
master is inactive.
Circuit Diagram:
Truth Table
Working:-
1.J = K = 0 (No change)
When clock = 0, the slave becomes active and master is inactive. But since 
the S and R inputs have not changed, the slave outputs will also remain 
unchanged. Therefore outputs will not change if J = K =0.
2.J = 0 and K = 1 (Reset)
1. Clock = 1 − Master active, slave inactive. Therefore outputs of the master 
become Q1 = 0 and Q1 bar = 1. That means S = 0 and R =1.
2. Clock = 0 − Slave active, master inactive. Therefore outputs of the slave 
become Q = 0 and Q bar = 1.
3. Again clock = 1 − Master active, slave inactive. Therefore even with the 
changed outputs Q = 0 and Q bar = 1 fed back to master, its output will 
be Q1 = 0 and Q1 bar = 1. That means S = 0 and R = 1.
4. Hence with clock = 0 and slave becoming active the outputs of slave will 
remain Q = 0 and Q bar = 1. Thus we get a stable output from the Master 
slave.
3.J = 1 and K = 0 (Set)
1. Clock = 1 − Master active, slave inactive. Therefore outputs of the master 
become Q1 = 1 and Q1 bar = 0. That means S = 1 and R =0.
2. Clock = 0 − Slave active, master inactive. Therefore outputs of the slave 
become Q = 1 and Q bar = 0.
3. Again clock = 1 − then it can be shown that the outputs of the slave are 
stabilized to Q = 1 and Q bar = 0.
4.J = K = 1 (Toggle)
1. Clock = 1 − Master active, slave inactive. Outputs of master will toggle. So 
S and R also will be inverted.
2. Clock = 0 − Slave active, master inactive. Outputs of slave will toggle.
3. These changed output are returned back to the master inputs. But since 
clock = 0, the master is still inactive. So it does not respond to these 
changed outputs. This avoids the multiple toggling which leads to the race 
around condition. The master slave flip flop will avoid the race around 
condition.
Triggering of Flip Flops:
 The output of a flip flop can be changed by bring a small change in the input 
signal.This small change can be brought with the help of a clock pulse or 
commonly known as a trigger pulse.
 When such a trigger pulse is applied to the input, the output changes and thus 
the flip flop is said to be triggered.
 Flip flops are applicable in designing counters or registers which stores data in 
the form of multi-bit numbers. 
 But such registers need a group of flip flops connected to each other as 
sequential circuits. And these sequential circuits require trigger pulses.
There are mainly four types of pulse-triggering methods. They differ in the 
manner in which the electronic circuits respond to the pulse. They are 
1. High Level Triggering
When a flip flop is required to respond at its HIGH state, a HIGH level 
triggering method is used. It is mainly identified from the straight lead from the 
clock input. 
2. Low Level Triggering:
When a flip flop is required to respond at its LOW state, a LOW level 
triggering method is used. It is mainly identified from the clock input lead along 
with a low state indicator bubble. 
3. Positive Edge Triggering
When a flip flop is required to respond at a LOW to HIGH transition state, 
POSITIVE edge triggering method is used. It is mainly identified from the clock 
input lead along with a triangle. 
4. Negative Edge triggering
When a flip flop is required to respond during the HIGH to LOW transition 
state, a NEGATIVE edge triggering method is used. It is mainly identified from the 
clock input lead along with a low-state indicator and a triangle. 
Clock Pulse Transition
The movement of a trigger pulse is always from a 0 to 1 and then 1 to 0 
of a signal. Thus it takes two transitions in a single signal. When it moves from 0 
to 1 it is called a positive transition and when it moves from 1 to 0 it is called a 
negative transition. 
The clocked flip-flops already introduced are triggered during the 0 to 1 transition 
of the pulse, and the state transition starts as soon as the pulse reaches the 
HIGH level. If the other inputs change while the clock is still 1, a new output 
state may occur. If the flip-flop is made to then the multiple-transition problem can 
be eliminated.
The multi-transition problem can be stopped is the flip flop is made to respond to 
the positive or negative edge transition only, other than responding to the entire 
pulse duration.
Flip Flop Conversions:
Procedure for Flip Flop conversion:
1. Conversion Table: Construct the characteristic table of required flip flop 
(unknown), and fill available (known) flip flop excitation.
2. Solve K map for given (known) flip flop as input and required flip flop as 
output.
3. Implement the required flip flop using the known flip flop.
The flip flop conversions are classified into different types which are:
1. SR Flip Flop to JK Flip Flop
2. JK-FF to SR-FF Conversion
3. SR-FF to D-FF Conversion
4. D-FF to SR-FF Conversion
5. JK-FF to T-FF Conversion
6. JK-FF to D-FF Conversion
7. D-FF to JK-FF Conversion
Register and sift Resister:
Flip-flop is a 1 bit memory cell which can be used for storing the 
digital data. To increase the storage capacity in terms of number of bits, we 
have to use a group of flip-flop. Such a group of flip-flop is known as 
a Register. The n-bit register will consist of n number of flip-flop and it is 
capable of storing an n-bit word.
The binary data in a register can be moved within the register from one 
flip-flop to another. The registers that allow such data transfers are called 
as shift registers. There are four mode of operations of a register.
1. Serial Input Serial Output (shift register)
2. Serial Input Parallel Output
3. Parallel Input Serial Output
4. Parallel Input Parallel Output (storage/buffer register)
Serial Input Serial Output:
Let all the flip-flop be initially in the reset condition i.e. Q3 = Q2 = Q1 = 
Q0 = 0. If an entry of a four bit binary number 1 1 1 1 is made into the 
register, this number should be applied to Din bit with the LSB bit applied 
first. The D input of FF-3 i.e. D3 is connected to serial data input Din. 
Output of FF-3 i.e. Q3 is connected to the input of the next flip-flop i.e. 
D2 and so on.
Block Diagram
Operation
Before application of clock signal, let Q3 Q2 Q1 Q0 = 0000 and apply LSB 
bit of the number to be entered to Din. So Din = D3 = 1. Apply the clock. 
On the first falling edge of clock, the FF-3 is set, and stored word in the 
register is Q3 Q2 Q1Q0 = 1000.
Apply the next bit to Din. So Din = 1. As soon as the next negative edge of 
the clock hits, FF-2 will set and the stored word change to Q3 Q2 Q1 Q0 = 
1100. Apply the next bit to be stored i.e. 1 to Din. Apply the clock pulse. As soon 
as the third negative clock edge hits, FF-1 will be set and output will be 
modified to Q3 Q2 Q1 Q0 = 1110.
Similarly with Din = 1 and with the fourth negative clock edge arriving, the 
stored word in the register is Q3 Q2 Q1 Q0 = 1111.

Serial Input Parallel Output
 In such types of operations, the data is entered serially and taken out in 
parallel fashion.
 Data is loaded bit by bit. The outputs are disabled as long as the data is 
loading.
 As soon as the data loading gets completed, all the flip-flops contain their 
required data, the outputs are enabled so that all the loaded data is made 
available over all the output lines at the same time.
 4 clock cycles are required to load a four bit word. Hence the speed of 
operation of SIPO mode is same as that of SISO mode.
Block Diagram
Parallel Input Serial Output (PISO)
 Data bits are entered in parallel fashion.
 Output of previous Flip Flop is connected to the input of the next one via a 
combinational circuit.
 The binary input word B0, B1, B2, B3 is applied though the same 
combinational circuit.
 There are two modes in which this circuit can work namely - shift mode or 
load mode.
Load mode
When the shift/load bar line is low (0), the AND gate 2, 4 and 6 become active 
they will pass B1, B2, B3 bits to the corresponding flip-flops. On the low going 
edge of clock, the binary input B0, B1, B2, B3 will get loaded into the 
corresponding flip-flops. Thus parallel loading takes place.
Shift mode
When the shift/load bar line is low (1), the AND gate 2, 4 and 6 become inactive. 
Hence the parallel loading of the data becomes impossible. But the AND gate 1,3 
and 5 become active. Therefore the shifting of data from left to right bit by bit on 
application of clock pulses. Thus the parallel in serial out operation takes place.
Block Diagram
Parallel Input Parallel Output (PIPO)
In this mode, the 4 bit binary input B0, B1, B2, B3 is applied to the data inputs 
D0, D1, D2, D3 respectively of the four flip-flops. As soon as a negative clock 
edge is applied, the input binary bits will be loaded into the flip-flops 
simultaneously. The loaded bits will appear simultaneously to the output side. Only 
clock pulse is essential to load all the bits.
Block Diagram
Bidirectional Shift Register
 If a binary number is shifted left by one position then it is equivalent to 
multiplying the original number by 2. Similarly if a binary number is shifted 
right by one position then it is equivalent to dividing the original number by 
2.
 Hence if we want to use the shift register to multiply and divide the given 
binary number, then we should be able to move the data in either left or 
right direction.
 Such a register is called bi-directional register. A four bit bi-directional shift 
register is shown in fig.
 There are two serial inputs namely the serial right shift data input DR, and 
the serial left shift data input DL along with a mode select input (M).

The main difference between latches and flip-flops is that 
 For latches when they are enabled, their output changes immediately 
when their inputs change.
 Latch is level sensitive and there is no use of clock. 
 Flip-flops have their output change only either at the rising or filling

There are basically five main types of latches and flip-flops: 
1. SR Flip-flop. 
2. D Flip flop. 
3. JK Flip-flop 
4. T Flip flop. 
5. Master-Slave Flip-flop.
The major differences in these flip-flop types are the number of inputs they 
have and how they change state.
1)SR Latch:-  RS latch have two inputs, S and R. S is called set and R is called reset. 
 The S input is used to produce HIGH on Q (i.e. store binary 1 in flip-flop). 
 The R input is used to produce LOW on Q (i.e. store binary 0 in flip-flop). 
 Q’ is Q complementary output, so it always holds the opposite value of Q. 
 The output of the S-R latch depends on current as well as previous inputs 
or state, and its state (value stored) can change as soon as its inputs 
change. 
Working:-
S=1, R=0—Q=0, Q’=1
This state is also called the SET state.
S=0, R=1—Q=1, Q’=0
This state is known as the RESET state.
In both the states the outputs are just compliments of each other and 
that the value of Q follows the compliment value of S.
S=0, R=0—Q=1, & Q’ =1 [Invalid]
If both the values of S and R are switched to 0 it is an invalid state 
because the values of both Q and Q’ are 1. They are supposed to be 
compliments of each other. Normally, this state must be avoided.
S=1, R=1—Q & Q’= Remember
If both the values of S and R are switched to 1, then the circuit 
remembers the value of S and R in their previous state.
SR Flip-Flop:-  It is basically S-R latch using NAND gates with an additional enable 
input. It is also called as level triggered SR-FF. 
 For this, circuit in output will take place if and only if the enable input 
(E) is made active.
 It is also called a Gated S-R flip flop.
 
(Block Diagram) (Circuit Diagram)
Truth Table
Working:-
I. A clock pulse [CP] is given to the inputs of the AND Gate. 
II. When the value of the clock pulse is '0', the outputs of both the AND Gates 
remain '0'. 
III. When CP is '1', this makes the values at S and R to pass through the 
NOR Gate flip flop. 
IV. But when the values of both S and R values turn '1', the HIGH value of CP 
causes both of them to turn to '0'.
S = R = 0: No change
If S =R = 0 then output of NAND gates 3 and 4 are forced to become 1.
Hence R' and S' both will be equal to 1. Since S' and R' are the input of 
the basic S-R latch using NAND gates, there will be no change in the state 
of outputs.
S = 0, R = 1, E = 1
Since S = 0, output of NAND-3 i.e. R' = 1 and E = 1 the output of NAND-
4 i.e. S' = 0.
Hence Qn+1 = 0 and Qn+1 bar = 1. This is reset condition.
S = 1, R = 0, E = 1
Output of NAND-3 i.e. R' = 0 and output of NAND-4 i.e. S' = 1.
Hence output of S-R NAND latch is Qn+1 = 1 and Qn+1 bar = 0. This is 
the reset condition.
S = 1, R = 1, E = 1
As S = 1, R = 1 and E = 1, the output of NAND gates 3 and 4 both are 0 
i.e. S' = R' = 0.
Hence the Race condition will occur in the basic NAND latch.
Excitation Table of the SR Latch
 During the design process we usually know the transition from present state 
to next state and wish to find the latch input conditions that will cause the 
required transition.
 For this reason, we need a table that lists the required inputs for a given 
change of state

Delay/Data Flip Flop / D Flip Flop
1. Delay Flip Flop or D Flip Flop is the simple gated S-R latch with a NAND
inverter connected between S and R inputs.
2. It has only one input. The input data is appearing at the output after some
time. Due to this data delay between i/p and o/p, it is called delay flip flop.
3. S and R will be the complements of each other due to NAND inverter.
Hence S = R = 0 or S = R = 1, these input condition will never appear.
This problem is avoid by SR = 00 and SR = 1 conditions.
(Block Diagram) (Circuit Diagram)
Truth Table
Working:-
1.E = 0
Latch is disabled. Hence no change in output.
2.E = 1 and D = 0
If E = 1 and D = 0 then S = 0 and R = 1. Hence irrespective of the
present state, the next state is Qn+1 = 0 and Qn+1 bar = 1. This is the
reset condition.
3.E = 1 and D = 1
If E = 1 and D = 1, then S = 1 and R = 0. This will set the latch and
Qn+1 = 1 and Qn+1 bar = 0 irrespective of the present state.
JK Flip-Flop:-

Excitation Table and K Map
 A J-K flip flop can also be defined as a modification of the S-R flip flop.
 The behaviour of inputs J and K is same as the S and R inputs of the S￾R flip flop. The letter J stands for SET and the letter K stands for CLEAR.
 If the J and K input are both at 1 and the clock pulse is applied, then the 
output will change state, regardless of its previous condition.
 If both J and K inputs are at 0 and the clock pulse there will be no change 
in the output. 
 There is no indeterminate condition, in the operation of JK.
Working:-  The circuit includes two 3-input AND gates. The output Q of the flip flop is 
returned back as a feedback to the input of the AND along with other 
inputs like K and clock pulse [CP]. 
 So, if the value of CP is ‘1’, the flip flop gets a CLEAR signal and with 
the condition that the value of Q was earlier 1. 
 Similarly output Q’ of the flip flop is given as a feedback to the input of the 
AND along with other inputs like J and clock pulse [CP]. 
 So the output becomes SET when the value of CP is 1 only if the value of 
Q’ was earlier 1
 The output may be repeated in transitions once they have been 
complimented for J=K=1 because of the feedback connection in the JK flip￾flop

 The T flip-flop is a single input version of the JK flip-flop where T is

Race Around Condition:
The race around condition will occur in JK flip flop when 
J = K = 1 and tpd (FF) < tpw.
To avoid race around condition.
tpw < tpd (FF) < TCLK
Master Slave JK Flip Flop:-
Master slave JK FF is a cascade of two S-R FF with feedback from the output of 
second to input of first. Master is a positive level triggered. But due to the 
presence of the inverter in the clock line, the slave will respond to the negative 
level. Hence when the clock = 1 (positive level) the master is active and the 
slave is inactive. Whereas when clock = 0 (low level) the slave is active and 
master is inactive.
Circuit Diagram:
Truth Table
Working:-
1.J = K = 0 (No change)
When clock = 0, the slave becomes active and master is inactive. But since 
the S and R inputs have not changed, the slave outputs will also remain 
unchanged. Therefore outputs will not change if J = K =0.
2.J = 0 and K = 1 (Reset)
1. Clock = 1 − Master active, slave inactive. Therefore outputs of the master 
become Q1 = 0 and Q1 bar = 1. That means S = 0 and R =1.
2. Clock = 0 − Slave active, master inactive. Therefore outputs of the slave 
become Q = 0 and Q bar = 1.
3. Again clock = 1 − Master active, slave inactive. Therefore even with the 
changed outputs Q = 0 and Q bar = 1 fed back to master, its output will 
be Q1 = 0 and Q1 bar = 1. That means S = 0 and R = 1.
4. Hence with clock = 0 and slave becoming active the outputs of slave will 
remain Q = 0 and Q bar = 1. Thus we get a stable output from the Master 
slave.
3.J = 1 and K = 0 (Set)
1. Clock = 1 − Master active, slave inactive. Therefore outputs of the master 
become Q1 = 1 and Q1 bar = 0. That means S = 1 and R =0.
2. Clock = 0 − Slave active, master inactive. Therefore outputs of the slave 
become Q = 1 and Q bar = 0.
3. Again clock = 1 − then it can be shown that the outputs of the slave are 
stabilized to Q = 1 and Q bar = 0.
4.J = K = 1 (Toggle)
1. Clock = 1 − Master active, slave inactive. Outputs of master will toggle. So 
S and R also will be inverted.
2. Clock = 0 − Slave active, master inactive. Outputs of slave will toggle.
3. These changed output are returned back to the master inputs. But since 
clock = 0, the master is still inactive. So it does not respond to these 
changed outputs. This avoids the multiple toggling which leads to the race 
around condition. The master slave flip flop will avoid the race around 
condition.
Triggering of Flip Flops:
 The output of a flip flop can be changed by bring a small change in the input 
signal.This small change can be brought with the help of a clock pulse or 
commonly known as a trigger pulse.
 When such a trigger pulse is applied to the input, the output changes and thus 
the flip flop is said to be triggered.
 Flip flops are applicable in designing counters or registers which stores data in 
the form of multi-bit numbers. 
 But such registers need a group of flip flops connected to each other as 
sequential circuits. And these sequential circuits require trigger pulses.
There are mainly four types of pulse-triggering methods. They differ in the 
manner in which the electronic circuits respond to the pulse. They are 
1. High Level Triggering
When a flip flop is required to respond at its HIGH state, a HIGH level 
triggering method is used. It is mainly identified from the straight lead from the 
clock input. 
2. Low Level Triggering:
When a flip flop is required to respond at its LOW state, a LOW level 
triggering method is used. It is mainly identified from the clock input lead along 
with a low state indicator bubble. 
3. Positive Edge Triggering
When a flip flop is required to respond at a LOW to HIGH transition state, 
POSITIVE edge triggering method is used. It is mainly identified from the clock 
input lead along with a triangle. 
4. Negative Edge triggering
When a flip flop is required to respond during the HIGH to LOW transition 
state, a NEGATIVE edge triggering method is used. It is mainly identified from the 
clock input lead along with a low-state indicator and a triangle. 
Clock Pulse Transition
The movement of a trigger pulse is always from a 0 to 1 and then 1 to 0 
of a signal. Thus it takes two transitions in a single signal. When it moves from 0 
to 1 it is called a positive transition and when it moves from 1 to 0 it is called a 
negative transition. 
The clocked flip-flops already introduced are triggered during the 0 to 1 transition 
of the pulse, and the state transition starts as soon as the pulse reaches the 
HIGH level. If the other inputs change while the clock is still 1, a new output 
state may occur. If the flip-flop is made to then the multiple-transition problem can 
be eliminated.
The multi-transition problem can be stopped is the flip flop is made to respond to 
the positive or negative edge transition only, other than responding to the entire 
pulse duration.
Flip Flop Conversions:
Procedure for Flip Flop conversion:
1. Conversion Table: Construct the characteristic table of required flip flop 
(unknown), and fill available (known) flip flop excitation.
2. Solve K map for given (known) flip flop as input and required flip flop as 
output.
3. Implement the required flip flop using the known flip flop.
The flip flop conversions are classified into different types which are:
1. SR Flip Flop to JK Flip Flop
2. JK-FF to SR-FF Conversion
3. SR-FF to D-FF Conversion
4. D-FF to SR-FF Conversion
5. JK-FF to T-FF Conversion
6. JK-FF to D-FF Conversion
7. D-FF to JK-FF Conversion
Register and sift Resister:
Flip-flop is a 1 bit memory cell which can be used for storing the 
digital data. To increase the storage capacity in terms of number of bits, we 
have to use a group of flip-flop. Such a group of flip-flop is known as 
a Register. The n-bit register will consist of n number of flip-flop and it is 
capable of storing an n-bit word.
The binary data in a register can be moved within the register from one 
flip-flop to another. The registers that allow such data transfers are called 
as shift registers. There are four mode of operations of a register.
1. Serial Input Serial Output (shift register)
2. Serial Input Parallel Output
3. Parallel Input Serial Output
4. Parallel Input Parallel Output (storage/buffer register)
Serial Input Serial Output:
Let all the flip-flop be initially in the reset condition i.e. Q3 = Q2 = Q1 = 
Q0 = 0. If an entry of a four bit binary number 1 1 1 1 is made into the 
register, this number should be applied to Din bit with the LSB bit applied 
first. The D input of FF-3 i.e. D3 is connected to serial data input Din. 
Output of FF-3 i.e. Q3 is connected to the input of the next flip-flop i.e. 
D2 and so on.
Block Diagram
Operation
Before application of clock signal, let Q3 Q2 Q1 Q0 = 0000 and apply LSB 
bit of the number to be entered to Din. So Din = D3 = 1. Apply the clock. 
On the first falling edge of clock, the FF-3 is set, and stored word in the 
register is Q3 Q2 Q1Q0 = 1000.
Apply the next bit to Din. So Din = 1. As soon as the next negative edge of 
the clock hits, FF-2 will set and the stored word change to Q3 Q2 Q1 Q0 = 
1100. Apply the next bit to be stored i.e. 1 to Din. Apply the clock pulse. As soon 
as the third negative clock edge hits, FF-1 will be set and output will be 
modified to Q3 Q2 Q1 Q0 = 1110.
Similarly with Din = 1 and with the fourth negative clock edge arriving, the 
stored word in the register is Q3 Q2 Q1 Q0 = 1111.

Serial Input Parallel Output
 In such types of operations, the data is entered serially and taken out in 
parallel fashion.
 Data is loaded bit by bit. The outputs are disabled as long as the data is 
loading.
 As soon as the data loading gets completed, all the flip-flops contain their 
required data, the outputs are enabled so that all the loaded data is made 
available over all the output lines at the same time.
 4 clock cycles are required to load a four bit word. Hence the speed of 
operation of SIPO mode is same as that of SISO mode.
Block Diagram
Parallel Input Serial Output (PISO)
 Data bits are entered in parallel fashion.
 Output of previous Flip Flop is connected to the input of the next one via a 
combinational circuit.
 The binary input word B0, B1, B2, B3 is applied though the same 
combinational circuit.
 There are two modes in which this circuit can work namely - shift mode or 
load mode.
Load mode
When the shift/load bar line is low (0), the AND gate 2, 4 and 6 become active 
they will pass B1, B2, B3 bits to the corresponding flip-flops. On the low going 
edge of clock, the binary input B0, B1, B2, B3 will get loaded into the 
corresponding flip-flops. Thus parallel loading takes place.
Shift mode
When the shift/load bar line is low (1), the AND gate 2, 4 and 6 become inactive. 
Hence the parallel loading of the data becomes impossible. But the AND gate 1,3 
and 5 become active. Therefore the shifting of data from left to right bit by bit on 
application of clock pulses. Thus the parallel in serial out operation takes place.
Block Diagram
Parallel Input Parallel Output (PIPO)
In this mode, the 4 bit binary input B0, B1, B2, B3 is applied to the data inputs 
D0, D1, D2, D3 respectively of the four flip-flops. As soon as a negative clock 
edge is applied, the input binary bits will be loaded into the flip-flops 
simultaneously. The loaded bits will appear simultaneously to the output side. Only 
clock pulse is essential to load all the bits.

Bidirectional Shift Register
 If a binary number is shifted left by one position then it is equivalent to 
multiplying the original number by 2. Similarly if a binary number is shifted 
right by one position then it is equivalent to dividing the original number by 
2.
 Hence if we want to use the shift register to multiply and divide the given 
binary number, then we should be able to move the data in either left or 
right direction.
 Such a register is called bi-directional register. A four bit bi-directional shift 
register is shown in fig.
 There are two serial inputs namely the serial right shift data input DR, and 
the serial left shift data input DL along with a mode select input (M).Syllabus:-

Flip-Flop:-
1) A flip-flop is a bi-stable device. It has 2 stable states. Its O/P remains 
either high or low. 
2) The high stable state is called SET. The other stable state is called 
RESET. 
3) It can store binary bit, rather 0 or 1. Thus, it has storing capability, 
i.e., memory.
4) The most commonly used application of flip flops is in the 
implementation of a feedback circuit 
The main difference between latches and flip-flops is that 
 For latches when they are enabled, their output changes immediately 
when their inputs change.
 Latch is level sensitive and there is no use of clock. 
 Flip-flops have their output change only either at the rising or filling 
edge of the enable signal.  Flip-flop is edge sensitive and we need clock to design a flip-flop 
There are basically five main types of latches and flip-flops: 
1. SR Flip-flop. 
2. D Flip flop. 
3. JK Flip-flop 
4. T Flip flop. 
5. Master-Slave Flip-flop.
The major differences in these flip-flop types are the number of inputs they 
have and how they change state.
1)SR Latch:-  RS latch have two inputs, S and R. S is called set and R is called reset. 
 The S input is used to produce HIGH on Q (i.e. store binary 1 in flip-flop). 
 The R input is used to produce LOW on Q (i.e. store binary 0 in flip-flop). 
 Q’ is Q complementary output, so it always holds the opposite value of Q. 
 The output of the S-R latch depends on current as well as previous inputs 
or state, and its state (value stored) can change as soon as its inputs 
change. 
Working:-
S=1, R=0—Q=0, Q’=1
This state is also called the SET state.
S=0, R=1—Q=1, Q’=0
This state is known as the RESET state.
In both the states the outputs are just compliments of each other and 
that the value of Q follows the compliment value of S.
S=0, R=0—Q=1, & Q’ =1 [Invalid]
If both the values of S and R are switched to 0 it is an invalid state 
because the values of both Q and Q’ are 1. They are supposed to be 
compliments of each other. Normally, this state must be avoided.
S=1, R=1—Q & Q’= Remember
If both the values of S and R are switched to 1, then the circuit 
remembers the value of S and R in their previous state.
SR Flip-Flop:-  It is basically S-R latch using NAND gates with an additional enable 
input. It is also called as level triggered SR-FF. 
 For this, circuit in output will take place if and only if the enable input 
(E) is made active.
 It is also called a Gated S-R flip flop.
 
(Block Diagram) (Circuit Diagram)
Truth Table
Working:-
I. A clock pulse [CP] is given to the inputs of the AND Gate. 
II. When the value of the clock pulse is ‘0’, the outputs of both the AND Gates 
remain ‘0’. 
III. When CP is ‘1’, this makes the values at S and R to pass through the 
NOR Gate flip flop. 
IV. But when the values of both S and R values turn ‘1’, the HIGH value of CP 
causes both of them to turn to ‘0’.
S = R = 0: No change
If S =R = 0 then output of NAND gates 3 and 4 are forced to become 1.
Hence R' and S' both will be equal to 1. Since S' and R' are the input of 
the basic S-R latch using NAND gates, there will be no change in the state 
of outputs.
S = 0, R = 1, E = 1
Since S = 0, output of NAND-3 i.e. R' = 1 and E = 1 the output of NAND-
4 i.e. S' = 0.
Hence Qn+1 = 0 and Qn+1 bar = 1. This is reset condition.
S = 1, R = 0, E = 1
Output of NAND-3 i.e. R' = 0 and output of NAND-4 i.e. S' = 1.
Hence output of S-R NAND latch is Qn+1 = 1 and Qn+1 bar = 0. This is 
the reset condition.
S = 1, R = 1, E = 1
As S = 1, R = 1 and E = 1, the output of NAND gates 3 and 4 both are 0 
i.e. S' = R' = 0.
Hence the Race condition will occur in the basic NAND latch.
Excitation Table of the SR Latch
 During the design process we usually know the transition from present state 
to next state and wish to find the latch input conditions that will cause the 
required transition.
 For this reason, we need a table that lists the required inputs for a given 
change of state
Characteristic Table
Delay/Data Flip Flop / D Flip Flop
1. Delay Flip Flop or D Flip Flop is the simple gated S-R latch with a NAND
inverter connected between S and R inputs.
2. It has only one input. The input data is appearing at the output after some
time. Due to this data delay between i/p and o/p, it is called delay flip flop.
3. S and R will be the complements of each other due to NAND inverter.
Hence S = R = 0 or S = R = 1, these input condition will never appear.
This problem is avoid by SR = 00 and SR = 1 conditions.
(Block Diagram) (Circuit Diagram)
Truth Table
Working:-
1.E = 0
Latch is disabled. Hence no change in output.
2.E = 1 and D = 0
If E = 1 and D = 0 then S = 0 and R = 1. Hence irrespective of the
present state, the next state is Qn+1 = 0 and Qn+1 bar = 1. This is the
reset condition.
3.E = 1 and D = 1
If E = 1 and D = 1, then S = 1 and R = 0. This will set the latch and
Qn+1 = 1 and Qn+1 bar = 0 irrespective of the present state.
JK Flip-Flop:-
Characteristic Table
Excitation Table and K Map
 A J-K flip flop can also be defined as a modification of the S-R flip flop.
 The behaviour of inputs J and K is same as the S and R inputs of the S￾R flip flop. The letter J stands for SET and the letter K stands for CLEAR.
 If the J and K input are both at 1 and the clock pulse is applied, then the 
output will change state, regardless of its previous condition.
 If both J and K inputs are at 0 and the clock pulse there will be no change 
in the output. 
 There is no indeterminate condition, in the operation of JK.
Working:-  The circuit includes two 3-input AND gates. The output Q of the flip flop is 
returned back as a feedback to the input of the AND along with other 
inputs like K and clock pulse [CP]. 
 So, if the value of CP is ‘1’, the flip flop gets a CLEAR signal and with 
the condition that the value of Q was earlier 1. 
 Similarly output Q’ of the flip flop is given as a feedback to the input of the 
AND along with other inputs like J and clock pulse [CP]. 
 So the output becomes SET when the value of CP is 1 only if the value of 
Q’ was earlier 1
 The output may be repeated in transitions once they have been 
complimented for J=K=1 because of the feedback connection in the JK flip￾flop
Truth Table: Excitation Table
T – Flip Flop:-
Characteristic Table And K Map:
 The T flip-flop is a single input version of the JK flip-flop where T is 
connected to both J and K inputs directly.
 When T = 0, the flip flop enters into Hold mode, which means that the 
output, Q is kept the same as it was before the clock edge.  When T = 1, the flip flop enters into Toggle mode, which means the output 
Q is negated after the clock edge, compared to the value before the clock 
edge.

Characteristic Table Excitation Table
Characteristic equation of T-Flip Flop:
Qn + 1 = T ⊕ Qn
Race Around Condition:
The race around condition will occur in JK flip flop when 
J = K = 1 and tpd (FF) < tpw.
To avoid race around condition.
tpw < tpd (FF) < TCLK
Master Slave JK Flip Flop:-
Master slave JK FF is a cascade of two S-R FF with feedback from the output of 
second to input of first. Master is a positive level triggered. But due to the 
presence of the inverter in the clock line, the slave will respond to the negative 
level. Hence when the clock = 1 (positive level) the master is active and the 
slave is inactive. Whereas when clock = 0 (low level) the slave is active and 
master is inactive.
Circuit Diagram:
Truth Table
Working:-
1.J = K = 0 (No change)
When clock = 0, the slave becomes active and master is inactive. But since 
the S and R inputs have not changed, the slave outputs will also remain 
unchanged. Therefore outputs will not change if J = K =0.
2.J = 0 and K = 1 (Reset)
1. Clock = 1 − Master active, slave inactive. Therefore outputs of the master 
become Q1 = 0 and Q1 bar = 1. That means S = 0 and R =1.
2. Clock = 0 − Slave active, master inactive. Therefore outputs of the slave 
become Q = 0 and Q bar = 1.
3. Again clock = 1 − Master active, slave inactive. Therefore even with the 
changed outputs Q = 0 and Q bar = 1 fed back to master, its output will 
be Q1 = 0 and Q1 bar = 1. That means S = 0 and R = 1.
4. Hence with clock = 0 and slave becoming active the outputs of slave will 
remain Q = 0 and Q bar = 1. Thus we get a stable output from the Master 
slave.
3.J = 1 and K = 0 (Set)
1. Clock = 1 − Master active, slave inactive. Therefore outputs of the master 
become Q1 = 1 and Q1 bar = 0. That means S = 1 and R =0.
2. Clock = 0 − Slave active, master inactive. Therefore outputs of the slave 
become Q = 1 and Q bar = 0.
3. Again clock = 1 − then it can be shown that the outputs of the slave are 
stabilized to Q = 1 and Q bar = 0.
4.J = K = 1 (Toggle)
1. Clock = 1 − Master active, slave inactive. Outputs of master will toggle. So 
S and R also will be inverted.
2. Clock = 0 − Slave active, master inactive. Outputs of slave will toggle.
3. These changed output are returned back to the master inputs. But since 
clock = 0, the master is still inactive. So it does not respond to these 
changed outputs. This avoids the multiple toggling which leads to the race 
around condition. The master slave flip flop will avoid the race around 
condition.
Triggering of Flip Flops:
 The output of a flip flop can be changed by bring a small change in the input 
signal.This small change can be brought with the help of a clock pulse or 
commonly known as a trigger pulse.
 When such a trigger pulse is applied to the input, the output changes and thus 
the flip flop is said to be triggered.
 Flip flops are applicable in designing counters or registers which stores data in 
the form of multi-bit numbers. 
 But such registers need a group of flip flops connected to each other as 
sequential circuits. And these sequential circuits require trigger pulses.
There are mainly four types of pulse-triggering methods. They differ in the 
manner in which the electronic circuits respond to the pulse. They are 
1. High Level Triggering
When a flip flop is required to respond at its HIGH state, a HIGH level 
triggering method is used. It is mainly identified from the straight lead from the 
clock input. 
2. Low Level Triggering:
When a flip flop is required to respond at its LOW state, a LOW level 
triggering method is used. It is mainly identified from the clock input lead along 
with a low state indicator bubble. 
3. Positive Edge Triggering
When a flip flop is required to respond at a LOW to HIGH transition state, 
POSITIVE edge triggering method is used. It is mainly identified from the clock 
input lead along with a triangle. 
4. Negative Edge triggering
When a flip flop is required to respond during the HIGH to LOW transition 
state, a NEGATIVE edge triggering method is used. It is mainly identified from the 
clock input lead along with a low-state indicator and a triangle. 
Clock Pulse Transition
The movement of a trigger pulse is always from a 0 to 1 and then 1 to 0 
of a signal. Thus it takes two transitions in a single signal. When it moves from 0 
to 1 it is called a positive transition and when it moves from 1 to 0 it is called a 
negative transition. 
The clocked flip-flops already introduced are triggered during the 0 to 1 transition 
of the pulse, and the state transition starts as soon as the pulse reaches the 
HIGH level. If the other inputs change while the clock is still 1, a new output 
state may occur. If the flip-flop is made to then the multiple-transition problem can 
be eliminated.
The multi-transition problem can be stopped is the flip flop is made to respond to 
the positive or negative edge transition only, other than responding to the entire 
pulse duration.
Flip Flop Conversions:
Procedure for Flip Flop conversion:
1. Conversion Table: Construct the characteristic table of required flip flop 
(unknown), and fill available (known) flip flop excitation.
2. Solve K map for given (known) flip flop as input and required flip flop as 
output.
3. Implement the required flip flop using the known flip flop.
The flip flop conversions are classified into different types which are:
1. SR Flip Flop to JK Flip Flop
2. JK-FF to SR-FF Conversion
3. SR-FF to D-FF Conversion
4. D-FF to SR-FF Conversion
5. JK-FF to T-FF Conversion
6. JK-FF to D-FF Conversion
7. D-FF to JK-FF Conversion
Register and sift Resister:
Flip-flop is a 1 bit memory cell which can be used for storing the 
digital data. To increase the storage capacity in terms of number of bits, we 
have to use a group of flip-flop. Such a group of flip-flop is known as 
a Register. The n-bit register will consist of n number of flip-flop and it is 
capable of storing an n-bit word.
The binary data in a register can be moved within the register from one 
flip-flop to another. The registers that allow such data transfers are called 
as shift registers. There are four mode of operations of a register.
1. Serial Input Serial Output (shift register)
2. Serial Input Parallel Output
3. Parallel Input Serial Output
4. Parallel Input Parallel Output (storage/buffer register)
Serial Input Serial Output:
Let all the flip-flop be initially in the reset condition i.e. Q3 = Q2 = Q1 = 
Q0 = 0. If an entry of a four bit binary number 1 1 1 1 is made into the 
register, this number should be applied to Din bit with the LSB bit applied 
first. The D input of FF-3 i.e. D3 is connected to serial data input Din. 
Output of FF-3 i.e. Q3 is connected to the input of the next flip-flop i.e. 
D2 and so on.
Block Diagram
Operation
Before application of clock signal, let Q3 Q2 Q1 Q0 = 0000 and apply LSB 
bit of the number to be entered to Din. So Din = D3 = 1. Apply the clock. 
On the first falling edge of clock, the FF-3 is set, and stored word in the 
register is Q3 Q2 Q1Q0 = 1000.
Apply the next bit to Din. So Din = 1. As soon as the next negative edge of 
the clock hits, FF-2 will set and the stored word change to Q3 Q2 Q1 Q0 = 
1100. Apply the next bit to be stored i.e. 1 to Din. Apply the clock pulse. As soon 
as the third negative clock edge hits, FF-1 will be set and output will be 
modified to Q3 Q2 Q1 Q0 = 1110.
Similarly with Din = 1 and with the fourth negative clock edge arriving, the 
stored word in the register is Q3 Q2 Q1 Q0 = 1111.

 There are two modes in which this circuit can work namely - shift mode or

Load mode
When the shift/load bar line is low (0), the AND gate 2, 4 and 6 become active 
they will pass B1, B2, B3 bits to the corresponding flip-flops. On the low going 
edge of clock, the binary input B0, B1, B2, B3 will get loaded into the 
corresponding flip-flops. Thus parallel loading takes place.
Shift mode
When the shift/load bar line is low (1), the AND gate 2, 4 and 6 become inactive. 
Hence the parallel loading of the data becomes impossible. But the AND gate 1,3 
and 5 become active. Therefore the shifting of data from left to right bit by bit on 
application of clock pulses. Thus the parallel in serial out operation takes place.

Parallel Input Parallel Output (PIPO)
In this mode, the 4 bit binary input B0, B1, B2, B3 is applied to the data inputs 
D0, D1, D2, D3 respectively of the four flip-flops. As soon as a negative clock 
edge is applied, the input binary bits will be loaded into the flip-flops 
simultaneously. The loaded bits will appear simultaneously to the output side. Only 
clock pulse is essential to load all the bits.

 Flip-flops have their output change only either at the rising or filling 
edge of the enable signal.  Flip-flop is edge sensitive and we need clock to design a flip-flop 
There are basically five main types of latches and flip-flops: 
1. SR Flip-flop. 
2. D Flip flop. 
3. JK Flip-flop 
4. T Flip flop. 
5. Master-Slave Flip-flop.
The major differences in these flip-flop types are the number of inputs they 
have and how they change state.
1)SR Latch:-  RS latch have two inputs, S and R. S is called set and R is called reset. 
 The S input is used to produce HIGH on Q (i.e. store binary 1 in flip-flop). 
 The R input is used to produce LOW on Q (i.e. store binary 0 in flip-flop). 
 Q’ is Q complementary output, so it always holds the opposite value of Q. 
 The output of the S-R latch depends on current as well as previous inputs 
or state, and its state (value stored) can change as soon as its inputs 
change. 
Working:-
S=1, R=0—Q=0, Q’=1
This state is also called the SET state.
S=0, R=1—Q=1, Q’=0
This state is known as the RESET state.
In both the states the outputs are just compliments of each other and 
that the value of Q follows the compliment value of S.
S=0, R=0—Q=1, & Q’ =1 [Invalid]
If both the values of S and R are switched to 0 it is an invalid state 
because the values of both Q and Q’ are 1. They are supposed to be 
compliments of each other. Normally, this state must be avoided.
S=1, R=1—Q & Q’= Remember
If both the values of S and R are switched to 1, then the circuit 
remembers the value of S and R in their previous state.
SR Flip-Flop:-  It is basically S-R latch using NAND gates with an additional enable 
input. It is also called as level triggered SR-FF. 
 For this, circuit in output will take place if and only if the enable input 
(E) is made active.
 It is also called a Gated S-R flip flop.

Truth Table
Working:-
I. A clock pulse [CP] is given to the inputs of the AND Gate. 
II. When the value of the clock pulse is ‘0’, the outputs of both the AND Gates 
remain ‘0’. 
III. When CP is ‘1’, this makes the values at S and R to pass through the 
NOR Gate flip flop. 
IV. But when the values of both S and R values turn ‘1’, the HIGH value of CP 
causes both of them to turn to ‘0’.
S = R = 0: No change
If S =R = 0 then output of NAND gates 3 and 4 are forced to become 1.
Hence R' and S' both will be equal to 1. Since S' and R' are the input of 
the basic S-R latch using NAND gates, there will be no change in the state 
of outputs.
S = 0, R = 1, E = 1
Since S = 0, output of NAND-3 i.e. R' = 1 and E = 1 the output of NAND-
4 i.e. S' = 0.
Hence Qn+1 = 0 and Qn+1 bar = 1. This is reset condition.
S = 1, R = 0, E = 1
Output of NAND-3 i.e. R' = 0 and output of NAND-4 i.e. S' = 1.
Hence output of S-R NAND latch is Qn+1 = 1 and Qn+1 bar = 0. This is 
the reset condition.
S = 1, R = 1, E = 1
As S = 1, R = 1 and E = 1, the output of NAND gates 3 and 4 both are 0 
i.e. S' = R' = 0.
Hence the Race condition will occur in the basic NAND latch.
Excitation Table of the SR Latch
 During the design process we usually know the transition from present state 
to next state and wish to find the latch input conditions that will cause the 
required transition.
 For this reason, we need a table that lists the required inputs for a given 
change of state
Characteristic Table
Delay/Data Flip Flop / D Flip Flop
1. Delay Flip Flop or D Flip Flop is the simple gated S-R latch with a NAND
inverter connected between S and R inputs.
2. It has only one input. The input data is appearing at the output after some
time. Due to this data delay between i/p and o/p, it is called delay flip flop.
3. S and R will be the complements of each other due to NAND inverter.
Hence S = R = 0 or S = R = 1, these input condition will never appear.
This problem is avoid by SR = 00 and SR = 1 conditions.
(Block Diagram) (Circuit Diagram)
Truth Table
Working:-
1.E = 0
Latch is disabled. Hence no change in output.
2.E = 1 and D = 0
If E = 1 and D = 0 then S = 0 and R = 1. Hence irrespective of the
present state, the next state is Qn+1 = 0 and Qn+1 bar = 1. This is the
reset condition.
3.E = 1 and D = 1
If E = 1 and D = 1, then S = 1 and R = 0. This will set the latch and
Qn+1 = 1 and Qn+1 bar = 0 irrespective of the present state.
JK Flip-Flop:-
Characteristic Table
Excitation Table and K Map
 A J-K flip flop can also be defined as a modification of the S-R flip flop.
 The behaviour of inputs J and K is same as the S and R inputs of the S￾R flip flop. The letter J stands for SET and the letter K stands for CLEAR.
 If the J and K input are both at 1 and the clock pulse is applied, then the 
output will change state, regardless of its previous condition.
 If both J and K inputs are at 0 and the clock pulse there will be no change 
in the output. 
 There is no indeterminate condition, in the operation of JK.
Working:-  The circuit includes two 3-input AND gates. The output Q of the flip flop is 
returned back as a feedback to the input of the AND along with other 
inputs like K and clock pulse [CP]. 
 So, if the value of CP is ‘1’, the flip flop gets a CLEAR signal and with 
the condition that the value of Q was earlier 1. 
 Similarly output Q’ of the flip flop is given as a feedback to the input of the 
AND along with other inputs like J and clock pulse [CP]. 
 So the output becomes SET when the value of CP is 1 only if the value of 
Q’ was earlier 1
 The output may be repeated in transitions once they have been 
complimented for J=K=1 because of the feedback connection in the JK flip￾flop

T – Flip Flop:-
Characteristic Table And K Map:
 The T flip-flop is a single input version of the JK flip-flop where T is 
connected to both J and K inputs directly.
 When T = 0, the flip flop enters into Hold mode, which means that the 
output, Q is kept the same as it was before the clock edge.  When T = 1, the flip flop enters into Toggle mode, which means the output 
Q is negated after the clock edge, compared to the value before the clock 
edge.

Characteristic equation of T-Flip Flop:
Qn + 1 = T ⊕ Qn
Race Around Condition:
The race around condition will occur in JK flip flop when 
J = K = 1 and tpd (FF) < tpw.
To avoid race around condition.
tpw < tpd (FF) < TCLK
Master Slave JK Flip Flop:-
Master slave JK FF is a cascade of two S-R FF with feedback from the output of 
second to input of first. Master is a positive level triggered. But due to the 
presence of the inverter in the clock line, the slave will respond to the negative 
level. Hence when the clock = 1 (positive level) the master is active and the 
slave is inactive. Whereas when clock = 0 (low level) the slave is active and 
master is inactive.
Circuit Diagram:
Truth Table
Working:-
1.J = K = 0 (No change)
When clock = 0, the slave becomes active and master is inactive. But since 
the S and R inputs have not changed, the slave outputs will also remain 
unchanged. Therefore outputs will not change if J = K =0.
2.J = 0 and K = 1 (Reset)
1. Clock = 1 − Master active, slave inactive. Therefore outputs of the master 
become Q1 = 0 and Q1 bar = 1. That means S = 0 and R =1.
2. Clock = 0 − Slave active, master inactive. Therefore outputs of the slave 
become Q = 0 and Q bar = 1.
3. Again clock = 1 − Master active, slave inactive. Therefore even with the 
changed outputs Q = 0 and Q bar = 1 fed back to master, its output will 
be Q1 = 0 and Q1 bar = 1. That means S = 0 and R = 1.
4. Hence with clock = 0 and slave becoming active the outputs of slave will 
remain Q = 0 and Q bar = 1. Thus we get a stable output from the Master 
slave.
3.J = 1 and K = 0 (Set)
1. Clock = 1 − Master active, slave inactive. Therefore outputs of the master 
become Q1 = 1 and Q1 bar = 0. That means S = 1 and R =0.
2. Clock = 0 − Slave active, master inactive. Therefore outputs of the slave 
become Q = 1 and Q bar = 0.
3. Again clock = 1 − then it can be shown that the outputs of the slave are 
stabilized to Q = 1 and Q bar = 0.
4.J = K = 1 (Toggle)
1. Clock = 1 − Master active, slave inactive. Outputs of master will toggle. So 
S and R also will be inverted.
2. Clock = 0 − Slave active, master inactive. Outputs of slave will toggle.
3. These changed output are returned back to the master inputs. But since 
clock = 0, the master is still inactive. So it does not respond to these 
changed outputs. This avoids the multiple toggling which leads to the race 
around condition. The master slave flip flop will avoid the race around 
condition.
Triggering of Flip Flops:
 The output of a flip flop can be changed by bring a small change in the input 
signal.This small change can be brought with the help of a clock pulse or 
commonly known as a trigger pulse.
 When such a trigger pulse is applied to the input, the output changes and thus 
the flip flop is said to be triggered.
 Flip flops are applicable in designing counters or registers which stores data in 
the form of multi-bit numbers. 
 But such registers need a group of flip flops connected to each other as 
sequential circuits. And these sequential circuits require trigger pulses.
There are mainly four types of pulse-triggering methods. They differ in the 
manner in which the electronic circuits respond to the pulse. They are 
1. High Level Triggering
When a flip flop is required to respond at its HIGH state, a HIGH level 
triggering method is used. It is mainly identified from the straight lead from the 
clock input. 
2. Low Level Triggering:
When a flip flop is required to respond at its LOW state, a LOW level 
triggering method is used. It is mainly identified from the clock input lead along 
with a low state indicator bubble. 
3. Positive Edge Triggering
When a flip flop is required to respond at a LOW to HIGH transition state, 
POSITIVE edge triggering method is used. It is mainly identified from the clock 
input lead along with a triangle. 
4. Negative Edge triggering
When a flip flop is required to respond during the HIGH to LOW transition 
state, a NEGATIVE edge triggering method is used. It is mainly identified from the 
clock input lead along with a low-state indicator and a triangle. 
Clock Pulse Transition
The movement of a trigger pulse is always from a 0 to 1 and then 1 to 0 
of a signal. Thus it takes two transitions in a single signal. When it moves from 0 
to 1 it is called a positive transition and when it moves from 1 to 0 it is called a 
negative transition. 
The clocked flip-flops already introduced are triggered during the 0 to 1 transition 
of the pulse, and the state transition starts as soon as the pulse reaches the 
HIGH level. If the other inputs change while the clock is still 1, a new output 
state may occur. If the flip-flop is made to then the multiple-transition problem can 
be eliminated.
The multi-transition problem can be stopped is the flip flop is made to respond to 
the positive or negative edge transition only, other than responding to the entire 
pulse duration.
Flip Flop Conversions:
Procedure for Flip Flop conversion:
1. Conversion Table: Construct the characteristic table of required flip flop 
(unknown), and fill available (known) flip flop excitation.
2. Solve K map for given (known) flip flop as input and required flip flop as 
output.
3. Implement the required flip flop using the known flip flop.
The flip flop conversions are classified into different types which are:
1. SR Flip Flop to JK Flip Flop
2. JK-FF to SR-FF Conversion
3. SR-FF to D-FF Conversion
4. D-FF to SR-FF Conversion
5. JK-FF to T-FF Conversion
6. JK-FF to D-FF Conversion
7. D-FF to JK-FF Conversion
Register and sift Resister:
Flip-flop is a 1 bit memory cell which can be used for storing the 
digital data. To increase the storage capacity in terms of number of bits, we 
have to use a group of flip-flop. Such a group of flip-flop is known as 
a Register. The n-bit register will consist of n number of flip-flop and it is 
capable of storing an n-bit word.
The binary data in a register can be moved within the register from one 
flip-flop to another. The registers that allow such data transfers are called 
as shift registers. There are four mode of operations of a register.
1. Serial Input Serial Output (shift register)
2. Serial Input Parallel Output
3. Parallel Input Serial Output
4. Parallel Input Parallel Output (storage/buffer register)
Serial Input Serial Output:
Let all the flip-flop be initially in the reset condition i.e. Q3 = Q2 = Q1 = 
Q0 = 0. If an entry of a four bit binary number 1 1 1 1 is made into the 
register, this number should be applied to Din bit with the LSB bit applied 
first. The D input of FF-3 i.e. D3 is connected to serial data input Din. 
Output of FF-3 i.e. Q3 is connected to the input of the next flip-flop i.e. 
D2 and so on.
Block Diagram
Operation
Before application of clock signal, let Q3 Q2 Q1 Q0 = 0000 and apply LSB 
bit of the number to be entered to Din. So Din = D3 = 1. Apply the clock. 
On the first falling edge of clock, the FF-3 is set, and stored word in the 
register is Q3 Q2 Q1Q0 = 1000.
Apply the next bit to Din. So Din = 1. As soon as the next negative edge of 
the clock hits, FF-2 will set and the stored word change to Q3 Q2 Q1 Q0 = 
1100. Apply the next bit to be stored i.e. 1 to Din. Apply the clock pulse. As soon 
as the third negative clock edge hits, FF-1 will be set and output will be 
modified to Q3 Q2 Q1 Q0 = 1110.
Similarly with Din = 1 and with the fourth negative clock edge arriving, the 
stored word in the register is Q3 Q2 Q1 Q0 = 1111.

Serial Input Parallel Output
 In such types of operations, the data is entered serially and taken out in 
parallel fashion.
 Data is loaded bit by bit. The outputs are disabled as long as the data is 
loading.
 As soon as the data loading gets completed, all the flip-flops contain their 
required data, the outputs are enabled so that all the loaded data is made 
available over all the output lines at the same time.
 4 clock cycles are required to load a four bit word. Hence the speed of 
operation of SIPO mode is same as that of SISO mode.
Block Diagram
Parallel Input Serial Output (PISO)
 Data bits are entered in parallel fashion.
 Output of previous Flip Flop is connected to the input of the next one via a 
combinational circuit.
 The binary input word B0, B1, B2, B3 is applied though the same 
combinational circuit.
 There are two modes in which this circuit can work namely - shift mode or 
load mode.
Load mode
When the shift/load bar line is low (0), the AND gate 2, 4 and 6 become active 
they will pass B1, B2, B3 bits to the corresponding flip-flops. On the low going 
edge of clock, the binary input B0, B1, B2, B3 will get loaded into the 
corresponding flip-flops. Thus parallel loading takes place.
Shift mode
When the shift/load bar line is low (1), the AND gate 2, 4 and 6 become inactive. 
Hence the parallel loading of the data becomes impossible. But the AND gate 1,3 
and 5 become active. Therefore the shifting of data from left to right bit by bit on 
application of clock pulses. Thus the parallel in serial out operation takes place.
Block Diagram
Parallel Input Parallel Output (PIPO)
In this mode, the 4 bit binary input B0, B1, B2, B3 is applied to the data inputs 
D0, D1, D2, D3 respectively of the four flip-flops. As soon as a negative clock 
edge is applied, the input binary bits will be loaded into the flip-flops 
simultaneously. The loaded bits will appear simultaneously to the output side. Only 
clock pulse is essential to load all the bits.
Block Diagram
Bidirectional Shift Register
 If a binary number is shifted left by one position then it is equivalent to 
multiplying the original number by 2. Similarly if a binary number is shifted 
right by one position then it is equivalent to dividing the original number by 
2.
 Hence if we want to use the shift register to multiply and divide the given 
binary number, then we should be able to move the data in either left or 
right direction.
 Such a register is called bi-directional register. A four bit bi-directional shift 
register is shown in fig.
 There are two serial inputs namely the serial right shift data input DR, and 
the serial left shift data input DL along with a mode select input (M).
